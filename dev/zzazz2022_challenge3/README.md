# Directory - dev/zzazz2022_challenge3

This directory contains the first program written for solving Cracker Cavern III.

It consists in an emulator that runs the password algorithm of this challenge in an attempt to bruteforce it.

Unfortunately, that proved to be too slow to be useful, but I still think it's neat code regardless.
