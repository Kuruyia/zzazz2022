===========================================================
Eastern Camp problem:
	Train A is exactly 200 miles west of train B.
	Train A starts travelling north at a constant speed of 85 mph.
	Then, 2 hours later, train B starts travelling east, at 90 mph.

	Exactly 5 hours after train A starts moving, how many miles apart are the two trains?
	Round the result down.

	Resolution:
		t = 0: A(-200; 0), B(0; 0)
		t = 2: A(-200; 170), B(0; 0)
		t = 5: A(-200; 425), B(270; 0)

	So, about the Lost Woods... You can
	get to the Eastern Edge from there!
	To do that, it's pretty simple.
	Just go east twice, then north twice!

Lost Woods:

	Lost Secret II: N,E,S,E [OK]
		You know Lost Woods? I remember
		there was a similar puzzle in an NES
		game of my childhood.
		Maybe the solution from that game
		could work in there too?
		Except replacing west with east,
		since the entrance is to the west.
		Definitely need to try it!

Wise Man's Adventure Log:
	Chapter I - The Edges
	Travelling to each edge will reward
	you with a unique field ability.
	Visiting north grants SURF,
	Visiting south grants CUT,
	Visiting east grants STRENGTH,
	Visiting west grants TELEPORT.

	Chapter II - About the North
	The northern fork is surely the
	biggest, but don't fear it's size.
	While the journey may be long, there
	are no obstacles on the way, making
	it one ofthe best edges to visit first.
	
	Chapter III - About the South
	After the rockfall incident, the path
	to the Southern Edge is blocked by
	pushable boulders.
	Make sure you have enough STRENGTH
	before going for the Southern Edge!

	Chapter IV - About the West
	The TELEPORT ability allows you to
	travel between camps easily.
	Just stand on the hallowed ground
	spots and choose your destination!
	Be wary that you have to visit your
	destination at least once beforehand.

	Chapter V - About the East
	The Lost Woods may be confusing, but
	if you ask the locals, you can easily
	get information about where to go!
	Reaching the Edge is particularly easy.
	Just help the girl do her homework.
	If you're bad at maths, you can just
	keep pestering her until she gives in.

	Fourth challenge:
		Requests a "certificate" from the server, with some
		interesting data inside:
		"holder=Aelita/type=silver"

		The returned "certificate" seems to be the encrypted
		authority, holder, certtype and serial.
		Are the first 16 bytes of this "certificate" the AES key/IV?
		NO: Just those first 16 bytes never change (authority=Cracke)

		The appraisal process seems to decrypt the "certificate"
		and display its contents (with some padding at the beginning
		and the end).

		Weird behavior observed when the holder is undefined,
		it seems that we can directly manipulate the bytes of
		the certificate type on bytes 0x2B to 0x2F of the
		decoded "certificate".
		Thanks to that, we can change the "silver" type
		to "gold" and get the wanted result!

		Writeup:
		The "certificate" is encrypted with AES, most likely using
		CBC.
		We can guess that the key and IV must always be the same,
		given that the first 16 bytes of every generated "certificate"
		is the same (this is the first cipher block).

		To get plaintext i+1, we must first decrypt cipher block i+1,
		then XOR the decryption result with cipher block i.
		That means that we can modify cipher block i to control the
		the contents of plaintext i+1, which will hopefully contain
		the "certificate" type.

		After some research, we see that the serial number has no
		real constraints on it (it is a 6-numbers number, but this
		is not enforced by the server) and that a "certificate" doesn't
		have to have an "holder" field (we can request a "certificate" from
		server by just specifying the "type" field and omitting the "holder"
		field).
		We also control the contents and size of the "holder" field, and
		the "type" field that we want to change is located right after
		the "holder" field, meaning we can more or less control the position
		of the "type" field, but more importantly, ensure that the "holder"
		field is in the cipher block before the cipher block that contains
		the "type" field.
		Finally, the "serial" field is the field before the "holder" field,
		but only the 4 last numbers of it are in the same cipher block than
		the "holder" field.

		Because we proved that the serial number format is not checked by
		the server, that the holder name doesn't have to appear, and the
		different positions of those fields in the cipher blocks, we
		know we can trivially change the "certificate" "type" field by
		thrashing the cipher block that's before, which contains the end
		of the serial number and the holder name. We know the server
		won't fail to appraise the "certificate" because one is
		corrupted and the other is missing, and so we'd successfully
		appraised a "gold" certificate.
